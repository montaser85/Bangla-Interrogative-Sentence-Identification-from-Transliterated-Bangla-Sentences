The transliterated sentences are classified into 2 classes, interrogative and non interrogative.
Two approaches are used for this purpose:
1. Supervised Learning Approach: SVM, KNN, MLP, logistic Regression
2. Deep Learning Approach: Implying A CNN model

***File Overview:
1.CNN : This folder contains the CNN model code and datasets
2. Data: Contains the data.
3. Supervised Learning: Contains the code for supervised learning approach and the dataset with the labels in result.txt. 



***Requirements for CNN:
Python 3
Tensorflow > 0.12
Numpy
